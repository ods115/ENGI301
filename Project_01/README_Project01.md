- Not breathe in the fumes of the solder
- Always be aware of where your end of your hot iron is
- Always turn off the iron when not in use

1) Solder Long Leads with 100 mil female headers onto the outside rows of the PocketBeagle. Make sure the headers are vertically placed
2) Create a solder bridge between the USB host pins (ID to GND) and (VB to VI) in the P1 header
3) Solder Short Leads with  100 mil female headers headers onto the inside rows of the PocketBeagle. Make sure these headers are vertically placed
4) After completing these soldering connections, plug your PocketBeagle into a solderless breadboard such that the USB port sticks off the board
