# ENGI 301 Project 02 - Printed Circuit Board
## Project Name: Pokey Clicker
### Author: Oscar D. Soto

**Overview**


The purpose of this project was to take the prototyped design from Project 01 (located in the ENGI 301 Directory) and convert it into an open-source printed circuit board (PCB) design that can be accessed by the development community. "Pokey Clicker," is a simple, beginner-level project utilzing the PocketBeagle development board. In broad, the project utilizes an LCD screen and tactile push-buttons as the main visual and tactile user interface platforms, respectively. Button clicks are used to move icons on the LCD screen; this functionality is made possible by the code developed for "Pokey Clicker," and can be accessed in the Project 01 directory. While the current iteration of the project only allows for one player, a second button was added to the PCB diagrams to make room for future implementations (i.e., the two-player mode). The PCB files were constructed using "Eagle," an electronic design automation (EDA) software that allows for PCB design.
