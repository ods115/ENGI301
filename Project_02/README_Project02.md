## Project Name: Pokey Clicker
### Author: Oscar D. Soto

**Overview**


The purpose of this project was to take the prototyped design from Project 01 (located in the ENGI 301 Directory) and convert it into an open-source printed circuit board design that can be accessed by the development community. The project, which has been named "Pokey Clicker," is a simple, beginner-level project utilzing the PocketBeagle development board. In broad, the project utilizes an LCD screen as the main visual interface for the users and incorporates push-buttons as tactile interace. Button clicks are used to move icons on the LCD screen.
